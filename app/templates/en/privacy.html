        <h2>1. What we collect</h2>
        <p>The General Knowledge application collects two types of data. On the one hand data related to users, and on
            the other hand data related to the configuration of the application on the server.</p>
        <h3>1.1. Data related to users</h3>
        <p>The only data linked to the users collected is the user ID. This identifier is collected when the user uses
            one of the test or profile commands. This identifier links the user to his number of points to save his
            progress and that he can have them
            later.
        </p>
        <h3>1.2. Configuration Data</h3>
        <p>Configuration data includes all the data that administrators of a server can save to keep their preferences
            for that server, so they donâ€™t have to save them every time. For now, this only includes the language used
            by the application.</p>
        <h3>1.3. Other data</h3>
        <p>To ensure that the collected data remains linked to the correct server, the server identifier is also
            collected for each of the operations mentioned above.</p>
        <h2>2. Data storage</h2>
        <p>All data is stored in a database. Only the bot creator (Piwy#2703) has access to it. Under no circumstances
            will this data be transmitted to another entity or person, except in the case of the addition of another
            developer to the development team.
            If this is the case, this person will be mentioned in this document.</p>
        <h3>2.1. Access method</h3>
        <p>All members of the server can view their points or those of other members via the profile or general ranking
            command of the server. However, they may not modify them, except in specific cases (see point 3).</p>
        <h2>3. Modification of data</h2>
        <p>The data can be modified in three different ways.</p>
        <h3>3.1. By the application</h3>
        <p>Userâ€™s points are automatically changed each time this user uses a test command. He gets points if he answers
            correctly, and he loses points if he doesnâ€™t.</p>
        <h3>3.2. By the server administrators</h3>
        <p>Administrators have the option to change the language used by the application in the server. They also have
            the option to change a memberâ€™s points. In both cases, the changes are saved automatically.</p>
        <h3>3.3. By the creator of the application</h3>
        <p>The creator (Piwy#2703), with access to the database, can modify the data directly in the database. However,
            this is never done unless the consent of the concerned user(s) is given.</p>
        <h2>4. Data deletion</h2>
        <p>The data collected are for an indefinite period. Usualy, they are never deleted. However, it is possible to
            submit a request for deletion of the data by e-mail or via Discord (see point 5). In order to delete the
            data, the ID of the server(s)
            concerned and the user ID will be requested.</p>
        <h2>5. Contact us</h2>
        <p>For every other information or for a request of suppression of the data, you can contact the creator of the
            application.</p>
        <p><b>By mail: </b><a href="mailto:byp.studio.bots@gmail.com">byp.studio.bots@gmail.com</a></p>
